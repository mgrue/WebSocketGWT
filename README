A simple GWT module to make the WebSocket object from JS available in Java.
Tested with Chrome 16 and FF8. 

Usage:

1. Include the module jar in your project's classpath

2. Add the following line to your module's gwt.xml file:
	<inherits name='ch.performancebuildings.websocket.WebSocketGWT'/>
	
3. In your Java code write:
	WebSocket ws = new WebSocket("ws://whateverhost");
	ws.addHandler(...);
	ws.send("some_message");
	
4. Enjoy or complain.
